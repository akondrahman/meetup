We are currently securing locations. Any meeting location suggestions are VERY appreciated.</p> <p>Members - or non members - interested in leading instructional sessions are invited to do so. Have a coffee shop nearby you prefer to meet in? Let us know and we'll announce and schedule your session on the Triangle WordPress Meetup calendar.</p> <p>Meeting formats can include ""Help Desk"" sessions held anywhere in the Triangle - even online. Help Desks provide members with one-on-one, free workshop assistance with knowledgeable WordPress users.</p> <p>Again, if interested in leading an instructional session, let us know.</p> <p>Any questions?
